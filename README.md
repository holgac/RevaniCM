RevaniCM
======

An attempt to develop a CMS using angular &amp; node

The aims are modularity, easy-templating, and stability.

The project is at it's early release and lacks even the basic CMS features.


Note: I started this project using an old account and then forked it to my real account.
The account 'revanthedarth' is me as well.
I changed the name after finding out that there is already an existing project called RevCMS.
